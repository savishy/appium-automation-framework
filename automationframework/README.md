# appium-automation-framework

This is a common automation framework based on Appium.

I am also using this application to learn the BDD approach to development.

## Background ##

Appium is good for automating many tasks but in my experience I have found it unsuitable
for several tasks such as:

* performing relatively complex operations based on `adb`
* executing tests in parallel on N connected Android devices

I originally developed an Appium Automation Framework while at iCelero between 2014
and 2015. I am now making an effort to recreate this automation framework and
hopefully, do it better this time.
